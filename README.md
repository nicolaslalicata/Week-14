## **Automation of SwagLabs!**

On the page (www.saucedemo.com) we can find several errors that make our automated tests fail.

 **Next I show the critical errors that the page contains**

 One user presenting problems for remove items for to cart and the images do not match the items that are sold. Also, when you want to buy an item, it does not let her put the last name and her cannot advance in the purchase process.


 The problem of another user is that he is blocked from the page and cannot access the full site.
 
 And the last user with problems has too long waiting times.


All users share that the titles are misplaced and do not correspond to the item they represent.
